### Ethereum Flight Delay Insurance(EFDI)


Why do we come out with this decentralized app? Because the operational cost of insurance company is quite high. Only 70% insure amount become the claim benefit of policyholders.

Empowered by block chain technology, our EFDI solution radically solved this problem.

First of all, all the flight delay insurances and claims data will upload to. It is unchangeable and traceable, easy to be accessed by both insurance companies and policyholder. 

Secondly, this solution will use Python scrapy spider to auto match scheduled vs  actual arrival time, automatically settle the claims every day.
